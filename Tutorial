Postgre

Start a Postgre server.

Launch Terminator.

Type d run --name postDB -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=madeofdust -p 3309:3309 -d postgres

This runs a Docker image called postDB in the background.

Type d logs postDB to see its startup logs.

Type telnet localhost 3307.

Trying ::1...
telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused
This command fails because nothing is running on port 3307.

Type telnet localhost 3309.

Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
J
8.0.22	Wxb;bOï¿½C(=k~|Mcaching_sha2_password
This command works because postDB is running on port 3309.

Type <CONTROL+]> and then type quit to exit out of telnet on port 3309.

Type d stop postDB.

Type telnet localhost 3309. This command fails because postgre is stopped.

Type d rm postDB.

Type d start postDB. This command fails because we deleted the Docker container called postDB.

Type d run --name postDB -d -e POSTGRES_ROOT_PASSWORD=lovethepoor -p 3309:3309 postgres:8.0.22 to recreate the Docker container.

Type d exec -it postDB /usr/bin/psql -U postgres postgres to run the postgres client that exists on the postgres server. Your password is lovethepoor.

The command can be split into two parts. The first part, d exec -it postDB, tells Docker to execute a command on the postDB container. The second part, /usr/bin/psql -U postgres postgres, is the command that is run on the container itself.
Type show databases;. This lists the databases available in Postgres.




Type \c postgres;.

Type \dt;. This lists the tables in the postgres database.

Type quit to exit the container.

Type d stop postDB and d start postDB to restart the container. This step is not necessary but is written here so you know how to restart a container based on its name.

Connect to a postgres server with a postgres client over the network.

Get your IP.

Type d run --rm -it postgres:8.0.22 postgres -h192.168.xxx.xxx /usr/bin/psql -U postgres postgres. Replace 192.168.xxx.xxx with your IP.

Type quit to exit the container.
